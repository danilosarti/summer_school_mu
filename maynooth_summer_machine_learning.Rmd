# Hello, presentations and what we will do here!!

- Tell us who you are, what you are working on, and what you hope to get out of the week. 
- What are Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning. 
- Where are these things being used? Why? 
- Languages or On how to talk to machines. 
- If you want to know what a brain is, you should build one!! 
- The brain: learning how to learn, focus, and diffuse modes of the brain, neurons, and neuron networks.
- Beyond the games!! 
- Step by Step example of application.

# Where are these things being used? Why? 

#  Languages or On how to talk to machines! 

# If you want to know what a brain is, you should build one!! 

# The brain: learning how to learn, focus, and diffuse modes of the brain, neurons, and neural networks.

- How many computers to make a brain?

# Deep learning... Deep fake!  


# Beyond the games!! Game theory and Algorithmic trading. 

# Step by Step example of application.
